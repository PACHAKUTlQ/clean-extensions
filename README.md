# Open Source Extensions

This repository consists of releases of open source Chromium extensions built by Github Actions directly from source code. Some open source patches may be applied to enable premium features if possible, and to improve privacy and security.

While most open source extensions are distributed via Chrome Web Store, there is no guarantee that the CWS versions are the same with the source code, with no extra telemetry (or even backdoor) added. On the other hand, browser extensions are too powerful to be trusted. Thus this repo aims to build extensions from source via Github Actions CI in a transparent way.
